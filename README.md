# Heartbeat

Heartbeat ensures your project's pulse is felt. It's a badge of activity for maintainers to communicate their presence.

## What is Heartbeat?

In the open-source realm, the silence in a repository often leads to the looming question: Is this project still maintained? Heartbeat answers this by providing a badge that signals your active presence without necessitating commits or feature updates.

## Usage

1. **Configure Your Repo**: Add a `.yaml` file in the `./hearts` directory to set up Heartbeat.
2. **Stay Updated**: Heartbeat checks for the latest commit. If it's been over 30 days, you're prompted for a 'beat'.
3. **Show Your Badge**: After you commit or provide a beat, Heartbeat updates your badge, which you can display in your repository.

## Why Heartbeat?

- **Transparency**: Offers clear, visual communication about the maintainer's activity.
- **Simplicity**: Easy to set up with just a YAML file.
- **Efficiency**: Avoids unnecessary commits, focusing on meaningful project updates.

## Quickstart

1. Fork or clone this repository.
2. Add the Heartbeat YAML configuration file to your `./hearts` directory.
3. Commit the file to your repository.

Heartbeat will do the rest, keeping your project's pulse visible to all.
